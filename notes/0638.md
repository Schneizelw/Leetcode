#   Shopping Offers


## 题目

In LeetCode Store, there are n items to sell. Each item has a price. However, there are some special offers, and a special offer consists of one or more different kinds of items with a sale price.

You are given an integer array price where price[i] is the price of the ith item, and an integer array needs where needs[i] is the number of pieces of the ith item you want to buy.

You are also given an array special where special[i] is of size n + 1 where special[i][j] is the number of pieces of the jth item in the ith offer and special[i][n] (i.e., the last integer in the array) is the price of the ith offer.

Return the lowest price you have to pay for exactly certain items as given, where you could make optimal use of the special offers. You are not allowed to buy more items than you want, even if that would lower the overall price. You could use any of the special offers as many times as you want.

```
Example 1:

Input: price = [2,5], special = [[3,0,5],[1,2,10]], needs = [3,2]
Output: 14
Explanation: There are two kinds of items, A and B. Their prices are $2 and $5 respectively. 
In special offer 1, you can pay $5 for 3A and 0B
In special offer 2, you can pay $10 for 1A and 2B. 
You need to buy 3A and 2B, so you may pay $10 for 1A and 2B (special offer #2), and $4 for 2A.
Example 2:

Input: price = [2,3,4], special = [[1,1,0,4],[2,2,1,9]], needs = [1,2,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: The price of A is $2, and $3 for B, $4 for C. 
You may pay $4 for 1A and 1B, and $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C. 
You need to buy 1A ,2B and 1C, so you may pay $4 for 1A and 1B (special offer #1), and $3 for 1B, $4 for 1C. 
You cannot add more items, though only $9 for 2A ,2B and 1C.
 

Constraints:

n == price.length == needs.length
1 <= n <= 6
0 <= price[i], needs[i] <= 10
1 <= special.length <= 100
special[i].length == n + 1
0 <= special[i][j] <= 50

```

## 思路

```
DFS:
special offers里面使用深度优先，因为相同的offer可以使用多次，所以暴力解就是
尝试special[1]，如果special[1]正常递归使用special[1], 知道1无法再使用则使用special[2], 重复1的过程, 一直到把所有的special用完，最后再直接从price买。
所以就是s1使用一次+s[1:n]的解的结果
s1使用两次+使用s[1:n]的解的结果
s1使用n次+使用s[1:n]的解的结果
s1使用0次+使用s[1:n]的解的结果
s2同上，取最小解就是最少的price和就是结果了

```

## 代码


```golang
func shoppingOffers(price []int, special [][]int, needs []int) int {
	total, index, res := 0, 0, math.MaxInt
	helper(price, special, needs, total, index, &res)
	//fmt.Printf("%+v", res)
	return res
}

func helper(price []int, special [][]int, needs []int, total, index int, res *int) {
	for i := index; i < len(special); i++ {
		if !checkOffer(special[i], needs) {
			continue
		}
		update(special[i], needs)
		total += special[i][len(special[i])-1]
		helper(price, special, needs, total, i, res)
		total -= special[i][len(special[i])-1]
		reset(special[i], needs)
	}
	if !enough(needs) {
		for i := 0; i < len(needs); i++ {
			total += needs[i] * price[i]
		}
	}
	if *res > total {
		*res = total
	}
}

func checkOffer(offer []int, needs []int) bool {
	for i := 0; i < len(needs); i++ {
		if offer[i] > needs[i] {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}

func update(offer []int, needs []int) {
	for i := 0; i < len(needs); i++ {
		needs[i] -= offer[i]
	}
}

func reset(offer []int, needs []int) {
	for i := 0; i < len(needs); i++ {
		needs[i] += offer[i]
	}
}

func enough(needs []int) bool {
	for i := 0; i < len(needs); i++ {
		if needs[i] != 0 {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}
