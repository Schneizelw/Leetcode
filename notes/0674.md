# Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence

## 题目 

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).


```
Example 1:
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 

Example 2:
Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 

Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
```

## 代码

```golang
func findLengthOfLCIS(nums []int) int {
    if len(nums) <= 1 {
        return len(nums)
    }
    cache,res := 1, 1
    for i:=1;i<len(nums);i++{
        if nums[i] <= nums[i-1] {
            cache = 0
        }
        cache += 1
        if cache > res { 
            res = cache
        }
    }
    return res
}
    
```
