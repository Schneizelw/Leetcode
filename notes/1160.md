# Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters


## 题目


u are given an array of strings words and a string chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from chars (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

 

Example 1:
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 2:
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
 

Note:

1 <= words.length <= 1000
1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
All strings contain lowercase English letters only.

## 思路

```
总结：
	hashtable 记录可以使用的字符以及次数。每个单词过后得恢复hash table
	因为key是字母，所以可以使用一个26长度的数组来作为hash table
```

## 代码


```golang
func countCharacters(words []string, chars string) int {
    hashmap, backups := [26]int{}, [26]int{}
    for _, ch := range []byte(chars) {
        backups[ch-'a']++
    }
    index, res := 0, 0
    for _, word := range words {
        for i := range backups {
            hashmap[i] = backups[i]
        }
        for index = 0; index < len(word); index++ {
            ch := word[index] - 'a'
            if hashmap[ch] == 0 {
                break
            } else {
                hashmap[ch]--
            }
        }
        if index == len(word) {
            res += len(word)
        }
        
    }
    return res
}
```
