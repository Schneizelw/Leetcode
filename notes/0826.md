#   Most Profit Assigning Work


## 题目

You have n jobs and m workers. You are given three arrays: difficulty, profit, and worker where:

difficulty[i] and profit[i] are the difficulty and the profit of the ith job, and
worker[j] is the ability of jth worker (i.e., the jth worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most worker[j]).
Every worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job can be completed multiple times.

For example, if three workers attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3. If a worker cannot complete any job, their profit is $0.
Return the maximum profit we can achieve after assigning the workers to the jobs.

```
Example 1:

Input: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]
Output: 100
Explanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get a profit of [20,20,30,30] separately.
Example 2:

Input: difficulty = [85,47,57], profit = [24,66,99], worker = [40,25,25]
Output: 0


Constraints:

n == difficulty.length
n == profit.length
m == worker.length
1 <= n, m <= 104
1 <= difficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i] <= 105
```

## 思路

```
动态规划：
关键点1：排序
要获取最大的受益，一定是找受益最高且能胜任的工作去做。
所以difficulty和profit组成一个数组按profit排序
worker按照能力高到低排序，每一个工人都从前往后找收益最高的工作。
关键点2：能力更高的员工收益一定比能力低的员工收益高
所以可以缓存index记录上一个员工(排序后)可胜任的工作的索引index，当前员工从index开始找即可。
因为当前员工一定不可能找到收益比上一个员工高的工作，只能往后找。
```

## 代码


```golang
func maxProfitAssignment(difficulty []int, profit []int, worker []int) int {
	work := make([][]int, len(profit))
	for i := 0; i < len(profit); i++ {
		work[i] = []int{difficulty[i], profit[i]}
	}
	// 收益高的工作在前面
	sort.Slice(work, func(i, j int) bool {
		return work[i][1] > work[j][1]
	})
	// 能胜任难度高的worker在前面
	sort.Slice(worker, func(i, j int) bool {
		return worker[i] > worker[j]
	})
	res := 0
	index := 0
	for i := 0; i < len(worker); i++ {
		// 较有能力的worker都无法满足最简单的工作，后面的也不用看了
		if index >= len(work) {
			break
		}
		for j := index; j < len(work); j++ {
			// 能胜任，且能拿到最大的收益
			if worker[i] >= work[j][0] {
				res += work[j][1]
				index = j
				break
			}
			// 最简单的工作都无法胜任
			if j == len(work)-1 {
				index = j + 1
			}
		}
	}
	//fmt.Printf("%+v", res)
	return res
}
```
