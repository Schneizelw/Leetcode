# New 21 Game 

## 题目 

lice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with 0 points, and draws numbers while she has less than K points.  During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range [1, W], where W is an integer.  Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets K or more points.  What is the probability that she has N or less points?

Example 1:
Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.

Example 2:
Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation:  Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of W = 10 possibilities, she is at or below N = 6 points.

Example 3:
Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
Output: 0.73278

Note:
0 <= K <= N <= 10000
1 <= W <= 10000

```golang
func new21Game(N int, K int, W int) float64 {
    var res float64
    if N >= K + W -1 || K == 0 {
        return 1.0
    }
    cache := make([]float64, K)
    onePoss := float64(1)/float64(W)
    var sumPoss float64
    for i := 1; i < K; i++ {
        if i <= W {
            cache[i] += onePoss
        } 
        if i > W + 1 {
            sumPoss -= cache[i-W-1]
        }
        cache[i] += sumPoss * onePoss
        sumPoss += cache[i]
    }
    sumPoss = 0.0
    for j := K-1; j >= 1 && j+W >= K; j-- {
        sumPoss += cache[j]
    }
    first := K - W
    for j := K; j <= N; j++ {
        if j <= W {
            res += onePoss
        }
        res += sumPoss * onePoss
        //fmt.Println(sumPoss)
        if first > 0 {
            sumPoss -= cache[first]
        }
        first++
    }
    return res
