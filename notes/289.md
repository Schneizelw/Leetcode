# Game of Life

## 题目：

  According to the Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.

```
example:
Input: 
[
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 
[
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,0]
]

```

## 思路：
 
  遍历每一个cell，对每一个cell处理，每一次处理遍历周围每一个结点，统计life的个数。
  
  如果当前cell值为1，且周围life的数量小于2或者大于3，或者，当前cell值为1，且life数量为3,表示这些点的需要死去或者重获新生，将这些点放到一个链表中。
  最后处理链表，将里边存放的x，y值的点翻转值。
  
  
## 代码：

```cpp

class Solution(object):
    def gameOfLife(self, board):
        """
        :type board: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify board in-place instead.
        """
        rows = len(board)
        if rows == 0:
            return 
        cols = len(board[0])
        s = []
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                count = 0
                for k in range(j-1,j+2):
                    if k<0 or k>=cols:
                        continue
                    if i-1>=0 and board[i-1][k]==1: 
                        count += 1
                    if i+1<rows and board[i+1][k]==1: 
                        count += 1
                    if k!=j and board[i][k]==1: 
                        count += 1
                key = board[i][j]
                if (key==0 and count==3) or (key==1 and (count<2 or count>3)) :
                    s.append((i,j))
        for coord in s:
            x,y = coord[0],coord[1]
            board[x][y] = 1 if board[x][y]==0 else 0
```
